## The Problem
Ash and his friends are on a new adventure to catch even more Pokemon! Before they set off on this journey they need some tools. As we all know every great Pokemon trainer needs a reliable Pokedex to identify Pokemon. It’s a good thing they have you! Ash has asked if you would be willing to build him a brand new Pokedex with core features and a couple of enhancements.

## Business Requirements
- Use the Pokemon API to make API requests for data [https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2). 
- Able to search for any Pokemon.
- Able to see a history of what has been searched and revisit at anytime.

## Technical Requirements
- You are allowed to use scaffolding technology like “Create React App” or similar.
- This project should be done with the latest React framework.
- This project should be done with the latest Redux framework.
- This project should be done using TypeScript.
- This project should be done using version control, preferably git.
- This project can be styled with SCSS/CSS or Styled Components if anything needs to be styled.
- This project should include a README that addresses anything you may not have completed. It should also address what additional changes you might need to make if the application were intended to run in a concurrent environment. Any other comments or thoughts about the project are also welcome.

## Bonus Points
- Able to see details about abilities, moves, species, sprites and types upon searching.
- Able to see other evolutions of Pokemon and be able to navigate to specific Pokemon in the evolution chain.
